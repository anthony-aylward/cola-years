On Feb. 10, 2020, after months of escalating labor action, UC Santa Cruz graduate students began a [full wildcat strike](https://payusmoreucsc.com/campaign-timeline/) in order to secure themselves a cost of living adjustment (COLA) of [$1,412 per month](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/21/university-california-santa-cruz-graduate-students-strike). Since then, the UCSC administration has [spent $300,000 per day](https://twitter.com/cityonahill/status/1230964376284254208) on hiring police to break the strike.

You can help striking grads by donating to their [support fund](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-fund-for-striking-workers-at-ucsc).
